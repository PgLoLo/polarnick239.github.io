[The Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) is the set of complex numbers $$c$$ for which the function $$f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c$$ does not diverge when iterated from $$z=0$$, 
i.e., for which the sequence $$\{ f_{c}(0),\>f_{c}(f_{c}(0)),\>\dots \}$$ remains bounded in absolute value.

Usefull fact: if $$\|P_{c}^{n}(0)\| > 2$$ - than that complex number $$c$$ does not belong to the Mandelbrot set.

If $$c=(x_0, y_0) = x_0 + y_0 \cdot i$$ and $$z=(x, y) = x + y \cdot i$$, than $$f_{c}(z) = z^2+c$$ $$ = x^2 + 2 x y \cdot i - y^2 + x_0 + y_0 \cdot i$$ $$ = (x^2 - y^2 + x_0, 2xy + y_0)$$.

We want to highlight such points on $$2D$$ plane that corresponding complex numbers belongs to the Mandelbrot set (pseudocode):

``` cpp
mandelbrotContains(x0, y0):
    x, y = x0, y0
    for iteration in 0...MAX_ITERATIONS:
        x, y = x*x - y*y + x0, 2*x*y + y0
        if sqrt(x*x+y*y) > 2:
            return false
    return true

drawMandelbrot(image):
    for x in image:
        for y in image:
            if mandelbrotContains(x, y):
                image[x, y] = true
            else:
                image[x, y] = false
```

Let's implement and tune performance of function, that calculates required number of iterations per pixel in ```mandelbrotContains(x, y)``` function. If that number is equal to ```MAX_ITERATIONS``` - 
 that pixel belongs to the Mandelbrot set.
 
Implementation on **C++** looks like {% include /commons/icon-github.html label="this:" link="https://github.com/PolarNick239/FPGABenchmarks/blob/c36b213bed3fbf6c714f3a819e820d3d393c9711/benchmarks/mandelbrot/src/mandelbrot_cpu.cpp#L13-L45" %}

``` cpp
void MandelbrotProcessorCPU::process(Vector2f from, Vector2f to,
                                     Image<unsigned short>& iterations) {
    size_t width = iterations.width;
    size_t height = iterations.height;

    float x_step = (to.x() - from.x()) / width;
    float y_step = (to.y() - from.y()) / height;

    for (size_t py = 0; py < height; py++) {
        float y0 = from.y() + y_step * py;

        for (size_t px = 0; px < width; px++) {
            float x0 = from.x() + x_step * px;

            unsigned short iteration;
            float x = 0.0f;
            float y = 0.0f;
            for (iteration = 0; iteration < MAX_ITERATIONS; iteration++) {
                float xn = x * x - y * y + x0;
                y = 2 * x * y + y0;
                x = xn;
                if (x * x + y * y > INFINITY) {
                    break;
                }
            }
            iterations(py, px) = iteration;
        }
    }
}
```

Notes: ```from``` and ```to``` are the coordinates of image corners on complex plane, ```INFINITY``` - divergence threshold (it is equal to ```2.0f```). 

For all following benchmarking I will run {% include /commons/icon-github.html label="this" link="https://github.com/PolarNick239/FPGABenchmarks/blob/c36b213bed3fbf6c714f3a819e820d3d393c9711/benchmarks/mandelbrot/src/mandelbrot_bench.cpp" %} executable, but for 2048x2048 image (```MAX_ITERATIONS = 10000``` like on github).

On my **Intel i7 6700** this implementation runs for **5545 ms**.

OpenMP parallelization
----------------------

But this CPU has 4 cores, and 8 threads because of hyper-threading, so let's crunch numbers in 8 threads by using **OpenMP** with adding only single line of code! {% include /commons/icon-github.html label="Code:" link="https://github.com/PolarNick239/FPGABenchmarks/blob/c36b213bed3fbf6c714f3a819e820d3d393c9711/benchmarks/mandelbrot/src/mandelbrot_cpu.cpp#L13-L45" %}

``` cpp
void MandelbrotProcessorCPU::process(Vector2f from, Vector2f to,
                                     Image<unsigned short>& iterations) {
    size_t width = iterations.width;
    size_t height = iterations.height;

    float x_step = (to.x() - from.x()) / width;
    float y_step = (to.y() - from.y()) / height;
    
    // The only line needed to add:
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (size_t py = 0; py < height; py++) {
        float y0 = from.y() + y_step * py;

        for (size_t px = 0; px < width; px++) {
            float x0 = from.x() + x_step * px;

            unsigned short iteration;
            float x = 0.0f;
            float y = 0.0f;
            for (iteration = 0; iteration < MAX_ITERATIONS; iteration++) {
                float xn = x * x - y * y + x0;
                y = 2 * x * y + y0;
                x = xn;
                if (x * x + y * y > INFINITY) {
                    break;
                }
            }
            iterations(py, px) = iteration;
        }
    }
}
```

The only important line here is ```#pragma omp parallel for```. **OpenMP** provides possibility to parallelize your code by inserting such simple pragmas.
 It is supported by most compilers (maybe only on **Mac OS X** it is not available out of the box).

In this case **OpenMP** takes care of distributing workload between all available cores. It was asked to do so on outer for-loop - so it will execute code-block of outer loop for some ```py``` on each thread.
 For example for each 8th ```py``` code-block can be executed on Core#8, each 7th out of 8 ```py``` - on Core#7 and so on.
 So expected speedup is up to **x8** times.
 
The same benchmark shows **1274 ms**. The speedup is ```5545 ms / 1274 ms = x4.3```. It is not close to **x8** because there are in fact only **4** real cores.
 Hyper-threading of single core can give benefit only when there are two parallel tasks that uses different execution resources of that core.
 The bottle-neck here is purely computational - and this part of CPU cannot be magically duplicated by hyper-threading.
 
So the current results are:

```
Speedup  Time    Implementation   Device

 x4.3   1274 ms	 Naive CPU        8 threads		
 x1.0   5545 ms	 Naive CPU        1 thread	

Cpu is Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz (4 cores, 8 threads by hyper-threading)
```

SIMD, SSE
---------

For a long time nearly all CPUs have extensions of [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) instructions.
 **SIMD** (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) makes possible to do some operation simultaneously on multiple operands.
 For example such instructions can calculate sum of $$a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4$$ and $$b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4$$, so the result is $$c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4$$, where $$c_i=a_i+b_i$$.
 So if instructions operates with **N** operands - it can give speedup around x**N** times.
 
The most popular extensions are **SSE**, **SSE2** and up to **SSE4.2**. Nowadays they are supported on nearly all typical CPUs and operates with **128-bits** data.
 In case of processing **32-bit** single-precision floating points it means up to **x4** speedup in ideal case.
 
All modern compiles supports **intrinsics** for such extensions.
 Example of **SSE** intrinsic is ```_mm_add_ps``` - it sums four floating point numbers (from processor's **SSE** register) with another four floating point numbers (from another register) and
 stores result in third register. More detailed description about all intrinsics can be found on very handy [Intel intrinsics guide](https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#text=_mm_add_ps&expand=109).
 Note that suffix of intrinsic name represents type of operands data. For example *ps* - for single-precision floating points, *pi16* - **16-bits** integers and so on.
  
Because intrinsics works with **4 32-bits operands** at time - we should do our computations in CPU registers, than unload data from result register to memory.

**C++** compiler will take care about mapping of our computations into registers, but we should help him by explicitly working with 4 values at time - by using special type: ```__m128``` - **128-bits** register.

Yes! Such a mess! Coding is very slow (of course if you do it only at times). [Intel intrinsics guide](https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#text=_mm_add_ps&expand=109)
 helps a lot - it has very good filters by extensions (for example you may not wanting suddenly use **AVX** because not all of your consumers have CPU that supports it), provides very strict descriptions and so on.
 
Note, that the final for-loop is a fallback to naive CPU version, because we may have number of data that is not a multiple of 4 and this way is the simplest one to deal with that values.

Performance results (in fact **SSE**, **SSE2** and **SSSE3** were used):

SIMD, AVX
---------
 
But we can go futher! After **SSE** new important instructions extension was **AVX** (proposed in 2008, supported since 2011 in **Sandy Bridge**).
 The main difference is wider registers - **256-bits** wide, so it can be twice faster! Note, that when code is adopted to **SSE** usage - adoptation to **AVX**
 is quite straightforward - just replace ```__m128``` with ```__m256``` and update code to minor functions changes (for example sometimes order of arguments changes).

Code is nearly the same as for **SSE**, but {% include /commons/icon-github.html label="anyway:" link="https://github.com/PolarNick239/FPGABenchmarks/blob/c36b213bed3fbf6c714f3a819e820d3d393c9711/benchmarks/mandelbrot/src/mandelbrot_cpu_avx.cpp#L19-L84" %}

AVX really give **x2** speedup over SSE.

OpenCL
------

OpenCL provides a uniform way to implement parallel computations that could be executed on many multi-core devices - GPUs and CPUs.
 The main code is in kernel source code with syntax based on **C99** and kernels are compiled in runtime (like shaders for OpenGL).
 So the application sends source code to available OpenCL driver (for example GPU driver or special driver for CPU) to compile and execute kernels.
 
The code is very similar to naive CPU version:

``` cpp
__kernel void mandelbrotProcess(__global unsigned short* iterations,
                                 int width, int height,
                                 float fromX, float fromY, float toX, float toY) {
    int px = get_global_id(0);
    int py = get_global_id(1);
    if (px >= width || py >= height) return;

    float x0 = fromX + px * (toX - fromX) / width;
    float y0 = fromY + py * (toY - fromY) / height;

    unsigned short iteration;
    float x = 0.0f;
    float y = 0.0f;
    for (iteration = 0; iteration < MAX_ITERATIONS; iteration++) {
        float xn = x * x - y * y + x0;
        y = 2 * x * y + y0;
        x = xn;
        if (x * x + y * y > INFINITY_THRESHOLD) {
            break;
        }
    }
    iterations[width * py + px] = iteration;
}
```

But the performance on **AMD R9 390X** is impressive - **6 ms**! **x924** speedup! The reason is the nature of executed task - it is ideal for parallel computations and the only bottle-neck is computations,
 no overhead for memory access, no if-else branching, only a lot of computations that can fit in registers and execution runs with full computation power of device. In case of **AMD R9 390X** raw power is **2816 cores** running at **1 Ghz**!

**OpenCL** kernels also can be run on CPUs - the test contains execution on **i7-6700** via two OpenCL drivers: by [Intel](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opencl-drivers) and by [AMD](http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/OpenCL2-Driver.aspx) (it supports Intel CPUs too):

```

And suddenly **Intel** driver performs better than **AVX** version! It means that it was able to successfully vectorize code using available on this CPU extensions: AVX and AVX2.
 AMD driver seems to just run given code on all available threads and it leads to the same performance level as naive parallelization.

**OpenCL** makes possible to use CPU and GPU power for parallel computations. And this is quite easy to code in comparison with CPU intrinsics usage.
 Even on CPU good performance often can be reached with just naive version of code compiled with OpenCL driver (Intel driver often able to vectorize code).
 But sometimes intrinsics required: if your consumers have no GPU and it is too hard for them to install Intel OpenCL driver, or if you have a lot of idle computers with powerful CPUs
 (for example idle servers with Xeons) and Intel driver was not able to vectorize your too complex code, and so on.
